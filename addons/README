To build this
* create a python-based build script named wscript
  - specifies source file (obj.source, ending with .cc for C++),
    name (obj.target) and
    version (VERSION) of the custom module
  - copy this one and modify only those three values
* enter: node-waf configure build
  - runs WAF, a Python-based build system
  - looks for wscript in current directory
  - creates build/Release/hello_1.o
    * object file that isn't needed at runtime
  - creates build/Release/hello.node
    * needed at runtime

To clean
* rm -rf build
